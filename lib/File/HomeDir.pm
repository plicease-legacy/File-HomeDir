=head1 NAME

File::HomeDir - Get the home directory for yourself or other users

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use File::HomeDir;
  
  # Modern Interface (Current User)
  $home = File::HomeDir->my_home;
  $docs = File::HomeDir->my_documents;
  $data = File::HomeDir->my_data;
  
  # Modern Interface (Other Users)
  $home = File::HomeDir->users_home('foo');
  $docs = File::HomeDir->users_documents('foo');
  $data = File::HomeDir->users_data('foo');
  
  # Legacy Interfaces
  print "My dir is ", home(), " and root's is ", home('root'), "\n";
  print "My dir is $~{''} and root's is $~{root}\n";
  # These both print the same thing, something like:
  #  "My dir is /home/user/mojo and root's is /"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

File::HomeDir is a module for dealing with issues relating to the
location of directories for various purposes that are "owned" by a user,
and to solve these problems consistently across a wide variety of
platforms.

This module provides two main interfaces.

A modern File::Spec-style interface with a consistent OO API and
different implementation modules to support various platforms,
and a legacy interface from version 0.07 that exported a home()
function by default and tied the %~ variable.

=head2 Platform Neutrality

In the Unix world, many different types of data can be mixed together
in your home directory.  On some other platforms, seperate directories
are allocated for different types of data.

When writing applications, you should try to use the most specific
method you can. User documents should be saved in C<my_documents>,
data to support an application should go in C<my_data>.

On platforms that do not make this distinction, all these methods will
harmlessly degrade to the main home directory, but on platforms that
care C<File::HomeDir> will Do The Right Thing(tm).

=head1 METHODS

Two types of methods are provided. The C<my_method> series of methods for
finding resources for the current user, and the C<users_method> (read as
"user's method") series for finding resources for arbitrary users.

This split is necesary, as on many platforms it is MUCH easier to find
information about the current user compared to other users.

All methods via a C<-d> test that the directory actually exists before
returning.

=head2 my_home

The C<my_home> takes no arguments and returns the main home/profile
directory for the current user.

Returns the directory path as a string, or dies if it cannot be found.

=head2 my_documents

The C<my_documents> takes no arguments and returns the directory for
the current user where the user's documents are stored.

Returns the directory path as a string, or dies if it cannot be found.

=head2 my_data

The C<my_data> takes no arguments and returns the directory where
local applications should stored their internal data for the current
user.

Generally an application would create a subdirectory such as C<.foo>,
beneath this directory, and store its data there. By creating your
directory this way, you get an accurate result on the maximum number
of platforms.

For example, on Unix you get C<~/.foo> and on Win32 you get
C<~/Local Settings/Application Data/.foo>

Returns the directory path as a string, or dies if it cannot be found.

=head2 users_home

  $home = File::HomeDir->users_home('foo');

The C<users_home> method takes a single param and is used to locate the
parent home/profile directory for an identified user on the system.

While most of the time this identifier would be some form of user name,
it is permitted to vary per-platform to support user ids or UUIDs as
applicable for that platform.

Returns the directory path as a string, or dies if it cannot be found.

=head2 users_documents

  $docs = File::HomeDir->users_documents('foo');

Returns the directory path as a string, or dies if it cannot be found.

=head2 users_data

Returns the directory path as a string, or dies if it cannot be found.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 home

  use File::HomeDir;
  $home = home();
  $home = home('foo');
  $home = File::HomeDir::home();
  $home = File::HomeDir::home('foo');

The C<home> function is exported by default and is provided for
compatibility with legacy applications. In new applications, you should
use the newer method-based interface above.

Returns the directory path to a named user's home/profile directory.

If provided no param, returns the directory path to the current user's
home/profile directory.

=head1 TIED INTERFACE

=head2 %~

  $home = $~{""};
  $home = $~{undef};
  $home = $~{$user};
  $home = $~{username};
  print "... $~{''} ...";
  print "... $~{$user} ...";
  print "... $~{username} ...";

This calls C<home($user)> or C<home('username')> -- except that if you
ask for C<$~{some_user}> and there is no such user, it will die.

Note that this is especially useful in double-quotish strings, like:

     print "Jojo's .newsrc is ", -s "$~{jojo}/.newsrc", "b long!\n";
      # (helpfully dies if there is no user 'jojo')

If you want to avoid the fatal errors, first test the value of
C<home('jojo')>, which will return undef (instead of dying) in case of
there being no such user.

Note, however, that if the hash key is "" or undef (whether thru being
a literal "", or a scalar whose value is empty-string or undef), then
this returns zero-argument C<home()>, i.e., your home directory:

=head1 TO DO

- Become generally clearer on situations in which a user might not
have a particular resource.

- Add support for the root Mac user (requested by JKEENAN).

- Add support for my_desktop (requested by RRWO)

- Add support for my_music (requested by MIYAGAWA)

- Merge remaining edge case code in File::HomeDir::Win32

- Add more granularity to Unix, and add support to VMS and other
esoteric platforms, so we can consider going core.

Anyone wishing to add support for the above are welcome to get an account
to my SVN and add it directly.
