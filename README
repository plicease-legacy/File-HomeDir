NAME
    File::HomeDir -- get home directory for self or other users

SYNOPSIS
      use File::HomeDir;
      print "My dir is ", home(), " and root's is ", home('root'), "\n";
      print "My dir is $~{''} and root's is $~{root}\n";
       # These both print the same thing, something like:
       #  "My dir is /home/user/mojo and root's is /"

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a function, `home', and also ties the in-all-
    packages variable `%~'.

    home()
        Returns a filespec to this user's home directory.

    home($user)
        Returns a filespec to the home directory of the given user, or undef
        if no such user.

        Note that the argument to this must be a defined value, and mustn't
        be a zero-length string, or a fatal error will result.

    `$~{$user}'
    `$~{username}'
    `"...$~{$user}..."'
    `"...$~{username}..."'
        This calls `home($user)' or `home('username')' -- except that if you
        ask for `$~{same_user}' and there is no such user, a fatal error
        results!

        Note that this is especially useful in doublequotish strings, like:

             print "Jojo's .newsrc is ", -s "$~{jojo}/.newsrc", "b long!\n";
              # (helpfully dies if there is no user 'jojo')

        If you want to avoid the fatal errors, first test the value of
        `home('jojo')', which will return undef (instead of dying) in case
        of there being no such user.

        Note, however, that if the hash key is "" or undef (whether thru
        being a literal "", or a scalar whose value is empty-string or
        undef), then this returns zero-argument `home()', i.e., your home
        directory.

    `$~{""}'
    `$~{undef}'
    `"...$~{''}..."'
        These all return `home()', i.e., your home directory.

    If running under an OS that doesn't implement `getpwid', this library
    tries to provide a sane return value for the no-argument `home()'. Under
    MacOS, for example, it tries returning the pathspect to the desktop
    folder. See source for full details.

    Under OSs that don't implement `getpwnam' (as `home($user)' calls), you
    will always get a failed lookup, just as if you'd tried to look up the
    home dir for a nonexistent user on an OS that *does* support `getpwnam'.

BUGS AND CAVEATS
    * One-argument `home($username)' is memoized. Read the source if you
    need it unmemoized.

    * According to the fileio.c in one version of Emacs, MSWindows (NT?)
    does have the concept of users having home directories, more or less.
    But I don't know if MSWin ports of Perl allow accessing that with
    `getpwnam'. I hear that it (currently) doesn't.

    * This documentation gets garbled by some AIX manual formatters.
    Consider `perldoc -t File::HomeDir' instead.

PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5; I've only used it under Perl 5.004, so for
anything lower, you're on your own.


INSTALLATION

You install File::HomeDir, as you would install any Perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of File::HomeDir in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl

For further information, see perldoc perlmodinstall


DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in HomeDir.pm.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.  See ChangeLog for recent changes.


MACPERL INSTALLATION NOTES

Don't bother with the makefiles.  Just make a File directory in your
MacPerl site_lib or lib directory, and move HomeDir.pm into there.
