Revision history for Perl extension File::HomeDir

0.60_01 ...
	# Introduces back-compatibility issues
	- No longer treat lack of a home directory as an error
	- More test written on the Israel.pm monthly meeting
	- Major upgrade to Darwin driver (CNANDOR)
	- Altered testing to allow cases where there are no "toys" directories
	- More cleanups for Darwin in the root case
	- Updating dependencies to something more modern
          (mostly to ensure certain fixes to certain problems exist)

0.58 Wed 10 May 2006
	# This release contains only build-time changes
	- Upgrade Module::Install to 0.62 final
	- AutoInstall is only needed for options, so remove auto_install

0.57 2006-03-10 Adam Kennedy  adamk@cpan.org
	# No functional changes
	- Upgraded Module::Install to 0.62
	  (M:I is relatively sane from 0.61)
	- Removing all use of UNIVERSAL::isa (the function)
	- Adding missing use Carp() in a couple of cases
	- Minor POD changes

0.56 2006-03-10 Adam Kennedy  adamk@cpan.org
	# No functional changes
	- I screwed up Module::Install 0.58
	- Fixed that, then incremented version to fix this

0.55 2006-03-05 Adam Kennedy  adamk@cpan.org
	- No functional changes
	- Documentation bug fix
	- Documented the todo list
	- Updated Module::Install to 0.58

0.54 2006-02-27 Adam Kennedy  adamk@cpan.org
	- Adding a dependency of Win32::TieRegistry's, so this installs.
	- Will remove it later when that bug is fixed in Win32::TieRegistry

0.53 2006-02-27 Adam Kennedy  adamk@cpan.org
	- Typo caused Makefile.PL not to require Win32::TieRegistry on Win32
	- Upgraded to Module::Install 0.57

0.52 2005-01-04 Adam Kennedy  adamk@cpan.org
	- Added initial Darwin support.

0.51 2005-12-30 Adam Kennedy  adamk@cpan.org
	- Fixed a typo where I left the require of the Windows module
	  as Win32. (Randy Kobes)

0.50 2005-12-26 Adam Kennedy  adamk@cpan.org

	- Rewrote the guts entirely to split functionality out into
	  platform-specific submodules, and to add more specialised
	  code for Win32.

0.07 2005-11-09 Adam Kennedy  adamk@cpan.org

	- Near-complete rewrite to modernise and prepare to
	  start merging in File::HomeDir::Win32.

	- "Traded" module in exchange for Data::JavaScript::Anon :)
	- Replaced Makefile.PL with Module::Install-based version that lists
	  its dependencies in a platform-sensitive way.
	  This also removes the need for evals.
	- Replaced tests with Test::More-based ones and improved
	  coverage.
	- Put the platform-specific code into if ( CONSTANT ) blocks
	  so they will compile out.
	- Otherwise cleaned up and improved the layout of the code
	- Added support for $ENV{HOMEDIR} and $ENV{HOMEPATH} on Win32
	- More-explicit testing before we return a path
	- Keep caching user home, but NOT "my" home in case the
	  process changes user.
